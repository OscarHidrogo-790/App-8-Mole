Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The code is designed to help diagnose whether a person is experiencing allergies or a cold based on their responses to questions. By answering these questions, the code calculates the probability of someone having allergies or a cold and presents the results accordingly.

 
Known Issues:
There are potential issues, such as variable initialization clarity, percentage calculation accuracy, and the visibility of the disclaimer.
